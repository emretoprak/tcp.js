It tries to level out the difference between and a client, making the communication more simple. It also has built-in JSON encoding/decoding.\r\n\r\n## Introduction\r\n\r\ntcp.js is a very simple module for node.js. It has developed because the use of the native net module in node.js, can be cumbersome to use for writing TCP servers and clients. Therefore tcp.js was developed, to make TCP communication very easy, by looking at the well-developed library for WebSocket-communication socket.io, and presenting a similar interface, with custom events and emits. \r\n\r\nBuilt in to tcp.js is JSON encoding and decoding, so that JavaScript objects can be passed seamlessly around from server to client and the other way around. While providing this easy interface, the original properties of the tcp library is still available, giving developers all the need for craftin fast and robust TCP applications.\r\n\r\n## How to Install\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ npm install tcp.js\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How to use\r\n\r\n### Server\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar sockets = require('tcp.js').server(1337);\r\n\r\nsockets.on('connection', function (socket) {\r\n  socket.send('news', { hello: 'world'});\r\n  socket.on('myEvent', function (data) {\r\n    console.log(data);\r\n  });\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Client\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar sockets = require('tcp.js').client('127.0.0.1', 1337);\r\n\r\nsockets.on('connection', function(socket) {\r\n  socket.on('news', function (data) {\r\n    console.log(data);\r\n    socket.send('myEvent', { my: 'data'});\r\n  });    \r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Author\r\nThis library is developed by kasmura\r\n\r\nHis website is www.kasmura.com\r\n\r\n## License\r\nThis is free and unencumbered software released into the public domain.\r\n\r\nAnyone is free to copy, modify, publish, use, compile, sell, or\r\ndistribute this software, either in source code form or as a compiled\r\nbinary, for any purpose, commercial or non-commercial, and by any\r\nmeans.\r\n\r\nIn jurisdictions that recognize copyright laws, the author or authors\r\nof this software dedicate any and all copyright interest in the\r\nsoftware to the public domain.
